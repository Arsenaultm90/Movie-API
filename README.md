# Movie Database API

The goal of this project was to get used to using APIs. The site is in a functioning state but needs some fixes.

# Current Errors

The onChange function of the search box is not synced with the fetch function causing movies to appear based on the last
few letters in the box even when its empty. This also stops the filtering dropdowns from working.

# Future Updates

- ~~I want to add a landing page that displays 10(API Limit) random movies when the search box is empty.~~
- ~~Add multi-page function if the search returns more than 10 results~~ (Cannot be done due to API limit)
- Add some style to the navbar.
- Add different categories(upcoming, popular, etc) to present the user with options without searching.
